## The Problem Being Tackled
<br/>
- LIGA spurred from the need at UChicago to have a portal that directly connects recruiters to specific RSOs (Recognized Student Organizations). There are certain exclusive organizations on campus that are known to have a direct pipeline to top companies in their respective sectors, but what about all the others that can't afford this luxury because of various reasons? 

## The Solution Being Developed
<br/>
- Establish a Handshake for every club on UChicago and beyond. What if we could facilitate this pipeline creation for every RSO on every campus? What if members of a club could register to a platform that compiles their information and creates an amazing recruitment profile, which they can afterwards send to recruiters and they can directly contact each member. Imagine the impact for both the recruiter and the recruited.

<br />

### Progress

<br />

1. [X] I used Linkedin-clone public project as skeleton to create the back-end of the platform. This allowed
me to learn by doing. This also let me do some modifications to model to my project's needs. 

2. [X] Initial login page ready. I completed the initial login page where you can sign in and also register. Now I need to add the different information I need from each user to sign up with a club or as a recruiter. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
